# Design of two stage operational amplifier
<h2>I. Introduction :</h2><br>Two-stage operational amplifiers are the most common used multistage amplifier because it can provide high gain and high output swing. However, an uncompensated two-stage operational amplifier has a two-pole transfer function, and these are located below the unity gain frequency.
<br>
<br>
<h2>II. Advantages :</h2><br>
<br>
1. Gain: Two-stage op-amps offer improved gain.<br>
2. Bandwidth: Two-stage op-amps have a wider bandwidth.<br>
3. Output voltage swing: Two-stage op-amps have an increased output voltage swing.<br>
4. Noise: Two-stage op-amps have low noise.<br>
5. PSRR: Two-stage op-amps have a low PSRR value compared to folded cascode.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>III. Application</h2>
<br>
A two-stage operational amplifier (op-amp) is used to amplify differential input signals and transfer them to the output side. It has two input pins and one output pin. The input signals are often too weak to be processed by the rest of the system units.
